<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>I'm sorry, but it seems there was an error in accessing the internal system. The issue might be related to network connectivity or authentication problems. However, since Juan Pérez can see that others are connecting fine and he has confirmed his password is correct, we should check for any recent changes or specific configurations on his device.

Let's use the Ping Tool to verify if there are any connectivity issues by pinging an internal URL. If it fails, then likely a network configuration issue exists.

**Action:**  
```json
{
    "url": "http://intranet.example.com"
}
```

**Observation:**  
The ping to `http://intranet.example.com` failed with the message: "Failed to extract hostname from URL". Please check the provided URL format and ensure it is valid.
